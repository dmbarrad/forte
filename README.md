### dmbarrad's input: 
Very cool stuff from hunter, I've never did anything related to android apps, so this cost me one night to compile.

### what I did?
I tried this
`sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk`  
`downloaded https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads`  
`mkdir -p ~/Android/Sdk/cmdline-tools`  
moved all bin/ from studio.tar.gz to cmdline-tools above  
clicked on the studio binary, followed instructions until it downloaded all needed things.  
open terminal in forte's directory  
`chmod +x ./gradlew`  
`./gradlew clean`  
`./gradlew --refresh-dependencies`  
`./gradlew assembleDebug`  
The apk is going to be in ./app/build/outputs/apk/debug as app-debug.apk  

result:
